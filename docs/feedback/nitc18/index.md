<b>Number of respondents: 42</b><br>
<b>Duration of the course: One semester (13 weeks) </b><br>
<b>Type of course: Elective.</b><br>
<br>
<p>A feedback questionnaire was circulated to all the students who credited

are summarized below</p>
<b>Major phases of the Project </b>(Each stage subsumes the previous
stages):<br>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Stage 12-14: Scheduling and kernel stack management</li>
<li>Phase 2: Stage 16-19: Device Handling, interrupts and Exceptions</li>
<li>Phase 3: Stage 20: Process Management</li>
<li>Phase 4: Stage 21-22: Interprocess Communication - Semaphore and
Signal-Wait</li>
<li>Phase 5: Stage 23-25: File System Implementation</li>
<li>Phase 6: Stage 26: User Management and access permissions</li>
<li>Phase 7: Stage 27: Memory Management - Disk swap management</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Q1. Student Performance: How many phases of the project did you complete?</b><br><br>
