**Arguments:** Disk block number, offset, data 


#### **Algorithm:**


Wait for the buffer and lock it.


If the disk block number is not present in the buffer already, use Dread routine of device manager module to read contents from the disk block to the buffer cache; if necessary by replacing existing page.


Write data to the offset.
