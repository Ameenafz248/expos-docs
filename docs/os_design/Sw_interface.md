Low Level System Call Interface
-------------------------------


  


* If the file
 is created with permission set to [EXCLUSIVE](../support_tools-files/constants.html), then
 write and delete system calls will fail when executed by any
 user other than the owner or the root (see [here](../os_spec-files/multiuser.html)).
 



** These System Calls are available only on eXpOS running on [NEXSM](../arch_spec-files/nexsm.html) (a two-core extension of XSM) machine.
